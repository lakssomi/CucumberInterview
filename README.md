# CucumberInterview
First I need to create maven project in my eclipse.
In order to execute our cucumber project first I need to add dependencies to my pom.xml.
Also I need to add one plugin called natural to get the .feature.
I created 3 files, 1 is feature file, 2 step definiton file and 3 testrunner.class
In feature file I have used some of the key words like Feature, Scenario, Background, Given, When, Then and And.
Each line in the scenarios called Steps.
I implemented the scenarios in Step definition file.
I used cucumber options in TestRunner file to execute feature file.
In cucumber options I have used parameters like Glue, Plugin.
